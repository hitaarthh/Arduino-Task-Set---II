### ⚡️ Introduction: 
- Registers are sequential circuits made with flipflops to store and transfer binary information.
- Shift registers are primarily made with D flipflops in a daisy chain structure. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)">flipflops</a> can each store one bit of binary information, all of which are controlled by a shared input clock. DFF's can read and store the value of the input signal at every rising edge of the clock. This property of the DFF can be used to build various registers. 
- Different forms of registers like SISO, SIPO, PISO, PIPO are differentiated by the way data is loaded and retrieved.
